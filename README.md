# House cost prediction with Python and Linear Regression

# Introduction
This repository will guide you through building a simple linear regression model using Python. 

We'll be using several Python libraries:

Scikit-learn: For machine learning models, including linear regression.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations on arrays and matrices.
Matplotlib: For data visualization.
Install these libraries using pip if you haven't already:

# Overview
Machine learning allows computers to learn from data and make predictions. In this tutorial, we'll focus on linear regression, a statistical method for modeling the relationship between two variables: an independent variable (house size) and a dependent variable (house price).

# Steps Covered
Data Collection: We'll use a dataset containing house sizes and prices.
Data Preparation: Cleaning and preparing the data for modeling.
Building the Model: Creating a linear regression model using Scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's accuracy and performance.
Making Predictions: Using the model to predict house prices for new data.
Linear Regression : Linear regression fits a linear equation to observed data to model the relationship between variables. In our case, it will help us predict house prices based on house sizes.

# Why Linear Regression?
Interpretability: Easy to interpret results and understand the impact of variables.
Efficiency: Quick to implement and provides a baseline model for more complex algorithms.
Applications: Widely used in real estate (predicting house prices), economics, and more.
